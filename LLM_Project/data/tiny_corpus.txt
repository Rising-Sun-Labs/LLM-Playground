This is a tiny corpus for language modeling.
Large Language Models learn statistical patterns in text and code.
Transformers use attention to relate tokens across a sequence.
We will train a small transformer on this sample data to demonstrate the pipeline.
The model can generate text, write emails, summarize, and do simple code review templates.
