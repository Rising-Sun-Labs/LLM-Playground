# LLM-Playground
LLM-Playground is a complete end-to-end learning and development environment for building your own in-house multimodal Large Language Model from scratch


### This project is designed for learners, builders, and teams who want to:
    ✅ Understand how LLMs actually work under the hood
    🧪 Build a transformer architecture from scratch
    🧰 Add multimodal capabilities (text + image + code)
    🚀 Pretrain and fine-tune the model on their own data
    🔐 Deploy it securely in-house
    
### ✨ Features
    📚 Step-by-step educational structure — learn everything from tokenizer to transformer internals.
    🧠 Custom model training — build and train your own LLM without relying on third-party model weights.
    🧩 Multimodal support — text, code, and image inputs.
    🧪 Fine-tuning support — adapt the base model to specific domains (e.g., code review, email writing, image captioning).
    🛠️ Efficient training — AMP, gradient checkpointing, quantization, and more.
    🧰 In-house deployment — inference server + CLI and web interface.
    🧑‍💻 Fully documented — perfect for beginners and teams learning LLMs.
