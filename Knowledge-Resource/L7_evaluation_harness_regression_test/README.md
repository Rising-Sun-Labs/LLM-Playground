# Lesson: 7 - How you measure your model and prevent regressions.

- we'll build a small, reusable evaluation harness for LMs + classifiers, and golden tests, and wire it to CI.

## 0) Goals

- Compute perplexity (PPL) for your LM on held-out set.
- add task evals (e.g., classification accuracy; prompt -> expected o/p checks)
- Create a golden test suite with pass/fail thresholds
- log results, compare to baselines, and block bad releases

### Why do we need reusable evaluation harness for LMs + classifiers, and golden tests, and wire it to CI.?

- Reusuable Evaluation Harness for LMs + Classifiers

  ```
  A reusable evaluation harness is a framework or toolset used to consistently evaluate the performance of machine learning models (like LLMs or classifiers) across various scenarios. This is crucial because:

      - Consistency in Evaluation: As models get more complex and are trained on diverse datasets, it’s easy to lose track of how different versions or configurations of the model perform across tasks. A reusable harness ensures that you can run evaluations in a consistent way every time.

       - Reproducibility: In machine learning research and production, it’s essential to be able to reproduce results from different experiments. A standardized evaluation harness makes this process easier by encapsulating the evaluation steps in one place.

      - Modularity: For LLMs and classifiers, you may need to evaluate them on different tasks (e.g., text generation, sentiment analysis, etc.), on different datasets, or with different configurations. A reusable harness allows you to plug in new models or tasks without reinventing the wheel every time.

      - Scalability: As the number of tasks or models grows, you need an automated and scalable way to test performance across all variations.

- Golden Tests

  ```
  Golden tests are a set of expected outputs or behaviors for a system. They serve as benchmarks for validation, ensuring that the model behaves as expected over time. This is especially useful for LLMs and classifiers for several reasons:

      - Model Stability: LLMs are typically updated frequently (e.g., with new data or improved architectures). Golden tests act as a safeguard, ensuring that the model's performance doesn’t degrade unexpectedly or that it doesn't start generating incorrect or biased results after an update.

      - Regression Testing: LLMs and classifiers can change in unexpected ways with each update. Golden tests help catch regressions—where a change in one part of the system breaks previously working functionality.

      - Quality Assurance: Golden tests help ensure that models continue to meet the desired quality standards, ensuring that they still deliver the right kind of responses, outputs, or classifications that meet user or business expectations.

      - Error Detection: By comparing model outputs against a known "golden" set, developers can quickly spot areas where the model might need further tuning or retraining.

  ```

- Wiring to Continuous Integration (CI)

  ```
  CI pipelines are essential for automating and streamlining the development process, and they become especially critical when working with LLMs and classifiers because:

    - Automated Testing: In machine learning systems, models are continuously iterated on, updated, and modified. By wiring the evaluation harness and golden tests to a CI pipeline, you ensure that automated tests are run whenever changes are made to the code or model. This minimizes the risk of introducing bugs or performance issues.

    - Faster Feedback: CI pipelines help provide faster feedback to developers. If something goes wrong—whether it's a performance drop, regression, or unexpected behavior—developers are alerted immediately, helping to pinpoint issues before they reach production.

    - Versioning and Deployment: In CI, models can be versioned and deployed automatically to various environments. The CI pipeline can ensure that the correct model version passes all evaluation checks and meets the golden test criteria before being deployed to production.

    - Collaboration: Machine learning models often involve many contributors (data scientists, engineers, etc.). A CI pipeline helps ensure that everyone is working with the latest version of the model, and it ensures a uniform testing procedure across the team.

    - Scalability of Updates: As LLMs are fine-tuned or retrained with new data, CI allows you to scale these updates efficiently, ensuring that all models and classifiers are properly validated before they are deployed, reducing the risk of a bad update impacting production.
  ```

### How They All work together:

    ```
        - Evaluation Harness + Golden Tests + CI form a robust testing and deployment framework that enables teams to track, validate, and improve LLMs and classifiers efficiently.

        - The evaluation harness ensures that models are tested across different tasks and configurations.

        - Golden tests ensure that changes to the model don't introduce bugs or performance issues.

        - CI ensures automated, consistent testing and validation, providing fast feedback and reducing manual testing overhead.
    NOTE: this setup makes model development and deployment more reliable, scalable, and maintainable over time, which is especially crucial for models like LLMs that are large, complex, and constantly evolving
    ```

The harness is framework-agnostic. For LM PPL it needs an LM adapter: (encode) → ids, (forward) → logits, (generate) → text (we’ll include simple defaults).
